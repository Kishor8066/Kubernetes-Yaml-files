- You can purposefully drain the node of all the workloads so that the workloads are moved to other nodes.
- The node is also cordoned or marked as unschedulable.
- When the node is back online after a maintenance, it is still unschedulable. You then need to uncordon it.
- There is also another command called cordon. Cordon simply marks a node unschedulable. Unlike drain it does not terminate or move the pods on an existing node.
- If any node has a pod, which is not part of any replicaset, then you cannot drain the node, due to that pod. 


kubectl drain node1
kubectl cordon node1
kubectl uncordon node1
If the node was down for more than 5 minutes, then the pods are terminated from that node

kube-controller-manager --pod-eviction-timeout=5m0s
