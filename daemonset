DaemonSets are like replicasets, as it helps in to deploy multiple instances of pod. But it runs one copy of your pod on each node in your cluster.

DaemonSets - UseCases

If you want to deploy monitoring agent and log collector in each of your nodes in the cluster, so you can monitor your cluster better. A DaemonSet is perfect for that, as it can deploy your monitoring agent in the form of a pod in all the nodes in your cluster. 


DaemonSet has similar configuration like Replica-set
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: monitoring-daemon
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: monitoring-agent
  template:
    metadata:
     labels:
       app: monitoring-agent
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: monitoring-agent
        image: monitoring-agent
```


$ kubectl create -f daemon-set-definition.yaml

$ kubectl get daemonsets

$ kubectl describe daemonsets monitoring-daemon
