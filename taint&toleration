Taints

- The taint effect defines what would happen to the pods if they do not tolerate the taint.
- There are 3 taint effects
	- NoSchedule
	- PreferNoSchedule
	- NoExecute

- Use kubectl taint nodes command to taint a node.

kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:taint-effect
kubectl taint nodes node1 app=blue:NoSchedule
